            ## Automated Scope Update
            
            This PR updates the OSSF Scorecard scope file with the latest discovered actions from the `devops-actions` organization.
            
            ### Changes
            - Automatically discovered all action repositories using `devops-actions/load-available-actions`
            - Filtered out archived repositories
            - Kept fork repositories in the list
            - Sorted repositories alphabetically
            
            ### Review Checklist
            - [ ] Verify all active action repositories are included
            - [ ] Confirm archived repositories are excluded
            - [ ] Check that no unexpected repositories were added
